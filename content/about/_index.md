Hey. I'm Jim... ðŸ‘‹

Like many Mac users, I began my career on the platform as a design artist in the early '90s. My love for Apple products began with a road-worn Mac SE/30. It was during those early years of working with Aldus PageMaker, Macromedia Freehand, and Adobe Photoshop that I learned the importance of keeping a computer system optimized.

This eventually led me to create Yasu (Yet another system utility) in 2002, which was a simple Mac OS X maintenance app. It became kind of popular through the 2000s. The popularity led to invitations to speak at user groups & conferences, and was featured in more than just a few Mac magazines. I turned the app over to another developer in 2017. Sadly, he didnâ€™t do much with Yasu. This site is to wrangle Yasu away from the other developer and bring it back to life.
