Eventually, I plan to move my website entirely to a Hugo site hosted on Github Pages. This is the first placeholder post of that move. Now, I need to write content.

Eventually, all of the content I've written over the years will end up here. Some posts have already been moved.

Then, my long-standing apex domain will serve it up.

More to come...
