Remember the late 90s and early 2000s when personal blogs were _the_ thing? Everybody had one and they were like online journals; authentic, raw, and an outlet for personal thoughts, ideas, and sometimes questionable opinions.

It kind of feels like those days are behind us, buried under the avalanche of social media. But are they really?

### Social Media and the Decline of the Blog

It didn’t happen overnight. Personal blogs didn’t just disappear in one big poof. It was more like a slow fade. As Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter took off, people – me included – found it easier to share bite-sized pieces of life. Why write a long, reflective post to publish on your personal site when you could sum it up in a quick status update that some “friend” you don’t really even know could give you a mindless like?

Therein lies the rub. Social media is all about convenience – fast, visual, and designed for quick consumption – like fast food for the mind. Scroll, like, move on. Blogs, on the other hand, ask for your time and thought. They’re like the home-cooked meals we don’t have time for anymore.

### Loss of Depth

Blogs were once a place for people to dive deep into ideas, emotions, and experiences. It wasn’t about only broadcasting the best parts of your life, but reflecting on the messiness, struggles, and painful lessons. You could get to know someone through their writing – see how they think, feel, and evolve over time.

Social media, on the other hand, with its character limits and algorithms pushing sensational, click-worthy content, doesn’t offer the same depth. Everything is a sizzle reel. You can still share long posts or threads, but how often do people really read them? We’ve learned to skim content, always hungry for the next hit of dopamine from a new notification or like.

### Why Blogs Mattered… And Still Do

There’s something about the personal blog that social media can’t replace. It’s not just about the writing. It’s about ownership. On a blog, you control the narrative. There’s no algorithm deciding whether a post will be seen or buried. Your thoughts are out there for whoever chooses to engage with them, free from the noise of sponsored or promoted posts and trending hashtags.

While social media offers instant gratification – likes, short comments, shares – a blog provides something deeper: connection. Real connection, with people who take the time to engage with your words because they want to, not because a platform nudged them into it.

### The Shift to Niche and Professional Blogging

Blogs were never really dead, but they’ve changed a lot since the early days. A good personal blog is hard to find now. Instead, we see more niche or professional blogs, where people share expert advice, reviews, or tutorials. These are useful, but often lack a personal touch that made blogging feel intimate back in the day.

Many of those people have turned their personal blogs into a business, focusing on SEO and monetization rather than genuine self-expression. While there’s nothing wrong with making money, it’s a far cry from the humble beginnings of blogging as a space for pure, unfiltered thoughts.

To be clear; you will never see an ad on my blog. This space is purely for my rumination – be it good or bad – and interactions with those who read.

### Can Personal Blogging Make a Comeback?

Maybe. There’s a growing disdain against the superficiality of social media. People are beginning to tire of the endless scrolling, filtered versions of someone else’s perfect life, and the pressure to perform. People are coming back around to authenticity and real conversations. There’s no better place for that than a personal blog.

For those of us who still love the art of long-form writing, and who crave meaningful connections over mindless scrolling, personal blogs offer a haven. My site may not get the instant attention or the engagement of a social post, but that’s the point – it’s meant for something deeper.

Is social media the death of the personal blog? Not quite. It may have nearly killed it, yes. But for those of us willing to carve out our own space in the digital landscape, personal blogs still have a heartbeat. It just takes more effort to keep it alive.

What do you think? Is blogging a lost art, or is there hope for a revival? Write about it on your own blog if you still have one and link back to this post. My site will automatically link back to yours – just like in the old days.

It’s time to get meaningful conversations happening again. Personal blogs are the perfect place for it.
