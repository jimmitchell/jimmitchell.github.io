I've used WordPress for more than 20 years. In those two decades, I learned a lot about PHP, CSS and Javascript. It taught me a lot about development.

I've tweaked and honed my own highly customized WordPress theme for the better part of 10 years, getting it to do exactly what I want. I think it turned out pretty slick.

I setup my own VPS to host my site with, endlessly tuning it to get the best possible performance I could out of it. I learned a lot about running a LAMP stack on Ubuntu.

I even developed a couple of WordPress plugins and published them on the plugin repository, hoping they might make me a couple bucks to cover hosting costs -- which of course never happened. Nonetheless, I made a contribution to Open Source in a small way.

I've enjoyed every single minute of it.

But it's time to move on to something new.

I discovered Hugo thanks to having an account on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) for a bit. I learned the Go templating language, tweaking my theme over and over (sense a pattern?). I even made a community plugin for the Micro.blog community.

I chose to leave Micro.blog because I didn't feel like paying for someone else's service. This got me to move to a VPS where I would have 100% control of everything. It was a lot of fun.

But then the "Mattening" happened. I won't go into the details, but I'm sure you've heard about it. It's pretty much what made me decide it's time to move on. That, and the fact that WordPress has become so bloated, making it way more than I need to blog simple posts. Plus, the fact that hosting my own VPS was costing me and I'm not making anything from my plugins.

So, I've chosen to use Hugo to generate a static site that gets published to Github pages on repo commit. It's a super simple workflow and fits my needs really well, and it doesn't cost me a dime.

There it is. I've stared over with a few posts from the past that I think are still relevant, but dumped all the other stuff.

Thanks for reading.
