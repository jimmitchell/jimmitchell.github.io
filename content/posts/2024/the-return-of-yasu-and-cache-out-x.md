summary: "After taking a break from both Yasu and Cache Out X, it's time to bring them back."

When I first developed Yasu, it was a springboard for me into learning how to code. Since it was an option back in 2000, and I had a pretty good handle on the language, I chose to build it as an AppleScript based app. You would have never known the fact in the final built product. It looked and acted like a true Mac app... Enough so that people really liked it and even paid money for it.

Fast forward a decade and things have changed -- a lot. AppleScript based apps are no longer a thing and Swift/SwiftUI is pretty much the defacto language for macOS apps.

I turned Yasu over to another developer in 2017. He released a minor update to it and then just let it sit, having done nothing with it. I was okay with that, or so I thought, until I started seeing more and more hits for both Yasu and Cache Out X (COX) in my server logs. This got me to thinking... Would I be able to start both apps fresh using SwiftUI and bring them back to their original glory?

I believe I can, so I challenged myself to learn SwiftUI and start rebuilding both of the apps.

Cache Out X (COX) was an app I took over from TriLateral Systems a long time ago. It was a competitor to Yasu and eventually I killed it off in favor of Yasu. I plan to bring it back as a browser cache management app for the major browswers, beginning with Safari and then adding other browsers over time.

I have no solid roadmap for either app right now, but I plan to work on COX first since it's going to be simpler. Once I've got it to a place I'm happy with, I'll focus on Yasu.
