Probably since the day after I turned Yasu over the other developer, I regretted doing it and told myself that I would bring my app back one day.

At the time, I just didn't have the bandwidth for it. So I put the idea in the back of my head and let it simmer.

Seven years have passed. The other developer has done nothing, as he promised he would. So, it's time to bring Yasu back to life. I see there's still a need for the simple maintenance app that Yasu was -- and will be again.

This site is dedicated to the journey it will take to get it back to where it once was. Follow along as we start again from scratch.

Thanks for reading.
