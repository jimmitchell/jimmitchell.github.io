Probably since the day after I turned Yasu over to the other developer, I regretted my decision and told myself I'd bring my app back one day, somehow.

At the time, I didn't have the bandwidth for it. So I put the idea in the back of my head and let it simmer -- for a long time.

Seven years have passed. The other developer has done nothing, as he promised he would. It's time to bring Yasu back to life. I see there's still a need for the simple maintenance app that Yasu was -- and will be again.

This site is to document the journey it takes to get Yasu back out there. Follow along as we start again from scratch.

Thanks for reading.
