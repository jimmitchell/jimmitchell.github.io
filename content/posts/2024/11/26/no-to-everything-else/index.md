I took some time off work during the Thanksgiving holiday after grinding on a work project for a really long time. I've found myself at a point over the last six months where I just don't feel effective and needed to figure out why.

During my quiet time this morning, I picked up _"[Hell Yeah or No](https://sive.rs/n)"_ by Derek Sivers again. I bought the physical book a couple months ago with a plan to finish it quickly. But, as I tend to do, I read about 10 pages and then set it aside, telling myself I'll get back to it eventually.

As I was powering through the book's anecdotes, one jumped [off the page](https://sive.rs/no2) and grabbed my attention.

> "Hell yeah or no" is a filter you can use to decide what's worth doing. But this is simpler and more serious. **This is a decision to stop deciding.** It's one decision, in advance, that the answer to all future distractions is "no" until you finish what you started. **It's saying yes to one thing, and no to absolutely everything else.**

It struck me that I've been saying yes far too often again. I'll get a great idea for a project and dive head first into it, while having a half-dozen similar projects already in the works.

There are also commitments to others I've said yes to that I don't want to show up for anymore. I have a bad habit of volunteering for something without thinking it through and it eventually becomes a drain on my energy.

What I need to do is focus on the "one big thing for now," and only that thing until it's finished. Everything else new is a hard no. There are still those commitments I have to show up for, but I don't have to put 100% effort into them until the one big thing is done.

The challenge now is to figure out what that one big thing is.
