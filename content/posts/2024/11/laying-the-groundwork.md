![The first run of the new Yasu](/img/first-run.jpeg)

The first steps of bringing Yasu back to life have been completed: Creating the project, commiting it to source control and purchasing a domain name.

Next up is a simple site for that domain and figuring out where to host it. I'm leaning towards a simple, one page Github Pages site.

After that, the hard part begins... Actually learning SwiftUI and hacking something into shape with what I learn. Do I focus on learning just the things I need to build my app, or do I focus on the fundamentals first, even though they may not be relevant to the end product?

I think the right approach is to focus on SwiftUI fundamentals. It may mean slow progress to begin with, but in the end I think it will mean a better product.
