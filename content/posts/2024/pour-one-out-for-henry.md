I'm saddened to learn of the passing of [Henry Carvajal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C15gmNOSP0) yesterday after battling cancer for a year and a half.

I can't say he and I were close friends, but when I was active in the Long Beach Blues scene, I was privileged to have shared the stage with him more than a dozen times.

Henry had chops and a great voice. He had style too. And to top it off, he was one of the more gracious musicians I've known.

This photo is from the last time I got to play with him on New Year's Eve, 2017.

That's Henry on guitar. I'm on bass. 

My wife and I went to support the band I used to play with and the evening turned into a jam, as they always do. We have great memories of that night.

This one's for you Henry. ðŸ¥ƒ Thanks for being a great human being. May you rest in peace. I'll catch you at the big jam in the sky one day...
