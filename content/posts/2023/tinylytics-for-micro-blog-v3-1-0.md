---
I'm excited to share I've released a new version of my [Tinylytics for Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101) plugin, bringing it to version 3.1.0. You should see an update in your site's plugins section soon if not already. This release adds features to link back to your public stats page on Tinylytics if you have it enabled, and show a webring avatar on the footer embed code if you so choose.
