Hot on the heels of [uptime monitoring on Tinylytics](https://vincentritter.com/2023/07/10/19-47-43), Iâ€™m stoked to share that my [Tinylytics for Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101) plug-in has been released as a 2.1 version to take advantage of it.

This release adds the following:

1.  The ability to use a [Hugo shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to add a Page View Counter in a post without changing any site template files. This will display the actual views of a single post, rather than overall hits -- which can still be shown as a footer embed.
2.  The ability to show your site uptime embedded in the global custom footer of your Micro.blog site without changing any site template files.

_**Note:** Uptime monitoring is a paid feature of Tinylytics. You'll need to have a paid account for uptime stats to show via this plugin._

You should see a new version available in your site plug-ins area soon.

For more details about using the plug-in, see the [README](https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog/blob/main/README.md) on the [Github project](https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog) page.
