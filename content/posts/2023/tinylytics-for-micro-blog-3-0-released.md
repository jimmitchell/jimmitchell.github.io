It took a minute to wrap up, but I'm happy to announce that my [Tinylytics for Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101) plugin has been updated to version 3.0, adding a bunch of new options to bring it to parity with [Tinylytics.app](https://tinylytics.app) features [@vincent](https://micro.blog/vincent) has released over the last couple of months.Notable enhancements made: - The ability to show the country flags of your Micro.blog visitors in either a footer embed or shortcode on a page. See the footer of this page for an example.

- The option to show a Tinylytics Webring link with custom link text in the footer embed. Again, see the footer for an example.
- A complete rewrite of the backend logic to make it scale better as Vincent adds more features.
