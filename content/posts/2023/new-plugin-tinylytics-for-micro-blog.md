I published my very first Micro.blog plugin today: **Tinylytics for Micro.blog**. You can find it in the Micro.blog [plugin directory](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101).

If you’re using [Vincent Ritter’s](https://micro.blog/vincent) awesome web analytics platform [Tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app), this plugin is for you. Rather than copying and pasting a line of Javascript, you simply enter your unique site id which can be copied from your site page once the plugin is installed.

There’s an option to toggle the “Display Hits” option too.

To show hits on your site, you’ll need to modify your Micro.blog theme to make the hits show up. The easiest way to accomplish this might be to add code in the footer of your theme’s design area (Design > Edit Footer):

See this Tinylytics [help article](https://tinylytics.app/docs/show_hit_counter) for more information on displaying hits on your site.

The plugin source can be found at this Github repo: [https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog](https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog).
