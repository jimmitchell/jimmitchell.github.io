I wasnâ€™t going to do a [post like this](https://defaults.rknight.me/)â€¦ But what the heck, all the [popular](https://canion.blog/2023/11/04/duel-of-the.html) [kids](https://grepjason.sh/2023/duel-of-the-defaults) are [doing it](https://loungeruminator.net/2023/11/17/mr-default/) this week, so why shouldnâ€™t I, right? Iâ€™m not really much of a defaults guy. Iâ€™ve always preferred to support indie developers, so will usually go that route if their app is as good or better than the Apple default.

Some extra utility apps in my toolbox I canâ€™t live withoutâ€¦

*   [**Launchbar**](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html): Itâ€™s the first app I install on any new Mac. Iâ€™m lost without it.
*   [**Bartender**](https://www.macbartender.com/): To hide menubar icons that are pointless.
*   [**FastScripts**](https://redsweater.com/fastscripts/): Assign a keystroke to AppleScripts to do various things.
*   [**Shottr**](https://shottr.cc/): For taking screenshots. The price canâ€™t be beat and it does a great job.
*   [**Magnet**](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/): Resize and arrange windows with a keystroke. Obviously, I hate taking my hands off the keyboard.
