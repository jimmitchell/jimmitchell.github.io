Fresh on the heels of new [Tinylytics.app](https://tinylytics.app) updates, my [Tinylytics for Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101) plug-in has been updated to take advantage of the new Kudos feature introduced in the latest release. If you look at your installed site plug-ins, you should see an update available as 1.0.6.

This release adds a checkbox to show Kudos along with the ability to set a custom label. See the project [README](https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog/blob/main/README.md) on Github for more information.
