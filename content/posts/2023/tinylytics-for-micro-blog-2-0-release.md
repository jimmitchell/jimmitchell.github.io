Iâ€™m happy to share that my [Tinylytics for Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101) plug-in has been released as a 2.0 version.

This release adds the following:

1.  A complete refactor/rewrite of the tracking code for better performance.
2.  The ability to use [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to add Kudos and Hit Counter in a post without changing any site template files.
3.  The ability to add a Hit Counter embed in the global custom footer of your Micro.blog site without changing any site template files.

You should see a new version available in your site plug-ins area soon.

For more details about using the plug-in, see the [README](https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog/blob/main/README.md) on the [Github project](https://github.com/jimmitchell/Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog) page.

If you have any other questions or find a bug, contact me through any of the methods in my site footer below.
