Taking a page from [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), this is the important stuff...

### Simplify

Evaluating everything I do to see if there's opportunity to reduce friction and effort. Potentially new blog posts coming out of this.

### Commitments

Slimming down the commitments I've already made and changing the habit of saying yes to new opportunities without thinking deeply about them first. For now, it's [no to everything](https://sive.rs/no2) that comes my way.

### Skill Up

I see potential for changes at the day job over the coming year or two, so I'm putting time into skilling up and gaining industry certifications should I find a transition necessary.

### Projects

- [ ] [Yasu](/yasu/). This is it. No other projects.
- [x] ~~Putting the finishing touches to my "**[mnml](https://github.com/jimmitchell/mnml)**" Micro.blog theme.~~
- [x] ~~Stubbing out some potential Micro.blog plugins.~~

More information about these and others can be found on my [projects](/projects/) page.
