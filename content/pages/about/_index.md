Hey. I'm Jim Mitchell... ðŸ‘‹

I'm the original developer of Yasu, a popular Mac maintenance utility app first released in the early 2000s. I've taken up development again, this time as an open source passion project. This is the official site for the app, dedicated to its resurrection. Ignore any other sites out there.

I love hearing from visitors, so if you want to ask a question, share a thought, or just chit-chat about Yasu, connect with me on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@jim), or [shoot me an email](mailto:hello@jimmitchell.dev).

Thanks for reading.
