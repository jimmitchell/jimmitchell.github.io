Hey. I'm Jim... ðŸ‘‹

I'm the original developer of Yasu, a popular Mac maintenance utility app that I originally released in the early 2000s. I've taken up development again. This is the official site for the app, dedicated to its resurrection. Ignore any other sites out there.

I love hearing from visitors, so if you want to ask a question, share a thought, or just chit-chat about Yasu, connect with me on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@jim), or [shoot me an email](mailto:hello@jimmitchell.dev).

Thanks for reading.
