Different projects I have going on...

### [Tinylytics for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jmitch-tinylytics/)
The [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) plugin companion to the very awesome [Tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app) platform by [@Vincent](https://micro.blog/vincent), this plugin enables all the features without having to modify your theme too much (or even at all).

### [100 Days](https://100.jimmitchell.dev)
