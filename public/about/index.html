I&rsquo;m Jim&mldr; üëã</p><p>Like many Mac users, I got my start on the platform as a design artist.</p><p>My love affair for all things Apple began with a road-worn Mac SE/30. It was during those early years working with Aldus PageMaker, Macromedia Freehand and Adobe Photoshop that I learned the importance of keeping a computer system in tip-top shape.</p><p>This led me to create the simple Mac OS X utility <a href=https://yasuapp.dev/yasu/>Yasu</a> in 2002, which is short for ‚ÄúYet another system utility.‚Äù Yasu became quite popular in the early 2000s, leading to featured articles in Mac magazines and getting me invitations to speak at user groups. In 2017, I turned the app over to another developer. If you‚Äôre looking to download the latest version that works with your macOS, visit the <a href=https://yasuformac.com>Yasu for Mac</a> site.</p><p>Today, I work as Director of Salesforce Applications for a well-known US-based TV manufacturer where I run the team responsible for their Salesforce initiatives (the wrangling nerds and herding cats thing). Since this is my personal site, all thoughts and ideas expressed here are strictly my own and in no way reflect those of my employer.</p><p>I‚Äôm a <a href=https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/jimmitchell>Salesforce certified administrator, developer, and consultant</a>. Other nerdy experience includes Microsoft SQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and just enough Java to make me dangerous to my peers. I can still get decent results out of Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop when I have to.</p><p>I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have found and married an extremely patient woman that I‚Äôd be completely lost without, and I have some pretty neat adult kids because of it. In my spare time, I like to write code, spend time with friends and family, play music, and enjoy getting outdoors on a hiking trail.</p><p>I love hearing from visitors, so if you want to ask a question, share a thought, or just chit-chat about Yasu, connect with me on <a href=https://social.jimmitchell.org/@jim>Mastodon</a>, or <a href=mailto:hello@jimmitchell.dev>shoot me an email</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; 2025 <a href=/about/>Jim Mitchell</a><br><span class=tinylytics_hits></span></p></footer></body></html>
