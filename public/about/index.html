I&rsquo;m Jim&mldr; ðŸ‘‹</p><p>Like many Mac users, I began my career on the platform as a design artist in the early &rsquo;90s. My love for Apple products began with a road-worn Mac SE/30. It was during those early years of working with Aldus PageMaker, Macromedia Freehand, and Adobe Photoshop that I learned the importance of keeping a computer system optimized.</p><p>This eventually led me to create <a href=https://yasuformac.com>Yasu (Yet another system utility)</a> in 2002, which was a simple Mac OS X maintenance app. It became kind of popular through the 2000s. The popularity led to invitations to speak at user groups & conferences, and was featured in more than just a few Mac magazines. I turned the app over to another developer in 2017. Sadly, he didnâ€™t do much with Yasu. Maybe Iâ€™ll get it back from him one day and bring it back to life somehow â€” but I kind of doubt it.</p><p>Today, I work as an IT Director for VIZIO, a well-known US based consumer TV brand, where I oversee their Salesforce initiatives. All thoughts and ideas expressed on this personal site are solely my own and do not reflect those of my employer whatsoever.</p><p>I am a certified Salesforce administrator, developer, and consultant, as well as a (formerly) certified Scrum Master. Other nerdy experience includes Microsoft SQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and just enough Java to make me really dangerous to my peers. I still get decent results out of Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop when I have to.</p><p>I am blessed to have found and married an amazing woman. Without her, I would be completely lost. I have some great kids because of her too. In my free time, I enjoy dinking with code, spending time with the family, playing music, or exploring the outdoors on an Orange County hiking trail.</p><p>I love hearing from visitors, so if you want to ask a question, share a thought, or just chit-chat, connect with me on <a href=https://social.lol/@jim>Mastodon</a>, or <a href=mailto:hello@jimmitchell.dev>shoot me an email</a>.</p><p>If you made it this far, I&rsquo;m really impressed.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; 2024 Jim Mitchell</p></footer></body></html>
