[{"content":"Hearing of the passing of Martin Mull reminded me of the time that I sort of met him quite by accident.\nMy daughter was a pretty good softball player in her early teens and would make the All-Star team in the town we lived in each season. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember what year or tournament it was, but we were at one of those all-weekend travel ball tournaments in Ventura, CA. It was still early in the morning and I went to the snack bar for a cup of coffee to shake the spiderwebs from my brain.\nAs I remember it, a humorous thing happened between me and the snack bar person. Out of nowhere, there was Martin Mull with a witty remark about the situation right next to me in line. I immediately recognized who he was, but was too starstruck to engage with him. I mumbled some incoherent thing back to him and walked off with my coffee. He must\u0026rsquo;ve thought I was a clod. I wish I\u0026rsquo;d handled that differently.\nIn hindsight, it struck me that he was exactly the same person I\u0026rsquo;d seen on TV so many times. His comedic timing was perfect for the moment. I think what threw me was that he was the one who engaged with me first. His level of fame allowed for him to just keep to himself, but he chose not to. That day, he was just another dad at the tournament with his daughter\u0026rsquo;s softball team.\nI always remember the day I sort of met him when I see an episode of some sitcom he was in. I especially enjoyed his work in Roseanne.\nIn honor of his passing, I think I might watch a little Fernwood 2Night, tonight\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2024/the-day-i-sort-of-met-martin-mull/","summary":"Hearing of the passing of Martin Mull reminded me of the time that I sort of met him quite by accident.

He had style too. And to top it off, he was one of the more gracious musicians I\u0026rsquo;ve known.\nThis photo is from the last time I got to play with him on New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, 2017.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s Henry on guitar.

I love my 13\u0026quot; M1, but I like the 15\u0026quot; M3 more. Typing feels less cramped for my big hands. Though the M3 is a mere 1/10th of a pound lighter, there seems to be even more of a weight difference between the two. Probably because of the larger overall footprint. I like the screen much better. At 500 nits vs. 300 for the M1, the screen pops more at full brightness. As a former design artist, this is important to me. The body has no micro-holes for speakers. I love this. My day job 16\u0026quot; MacBook Pro does, and all kinds of dust gets stuck in the tiny holes. I plan to do some sound comparisons between the M1 and M3 tonight. The notch was noticeable when I first started setting it up, but after a while it sort of faded into the background. Thankfully Bartender 5\u0026rsquo;s menu bar styles helped with this. Having a MagSafe charger again is great. I always thought that was a brilliant design and was sad when Apple moved away from it. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to see MagSafe making a comeback. Plus it opens up an extra USB-C port. I like the smaller screen bezel. It makes the screen feel bigger than it really is. It\u0026rsquo;s fast. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I got the top spec. Sadly, it\u0026rsquo;s just a little too wide for my favorite Crumpler messenger bag I\u0026rsquo;ve had for 15+ years. I see a replacement purchase in the near future here. All in all, after just a few hours of use, it\u0026rsquo;s a buy I\u0026rsquo;m pleased with. More thoughts to come in the next week or two.\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2024/macbook-air-m3-15-first-impressions/","summary":"My initial thoughts on the MacBook Air M3 15\u0026quot; fully specd model\u0026hellip;","title":"MacBook Air M3 15\" First Impressions"},{"content":"Events happen in our lives that make us do a full stop and give a long, hard look at how things are. This was one of those events that slapped me in the face so hard I\u0026rsquo;m still having a hard time grasping it.\nAbout a week ago, I had a heart related event that sent me to the emergency room. It was serious enough that the doctor point blank told me it could have been deadly had I not paid attention to it.\nWhen I woke up at 3:30 am last Thursday, my heart was palpitating and racing at over 150 bpm. I thought for sure I was having a heart attack. I woke my wife and we sped to the closest ER (she drove).\nWhen the doctor examined me, my heart was in an state of Afib (atrial fibrillation). They pumped me full of drugs to bring my heart below 100 bpm and hopefully put me back into a sinus rhythm. They were able to get the heart rate down a little, but it fluctuated between 90 and 120 bpm for hours. They weren\u0026rsquo;t able to get me back into a sinus rhythm either.\nUltimately, I was admitted to the hospital. My heart finally went back into a sinus rhythm after 19 very exhausting hours. After several tests, the cardiologist was able to determine this is a defect I\u0026rsquo;ve had all my life. I\u0026rsquo;d had small episodes as long as I can remember, but never thought anything of it. It\u0026rsquo;s forcing some big changes to my lifestyle. Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;m still here to write about it.\nThe most terrible and heartbreaking part of this story is that another man, just a year younger than me (having overheard his age), was put into the ER bed right next to me complaining of excruciating back pain. Like me, he walked in under his own power. Within 30 minutes of arrival, he went unresponsive and ultimately passed away from heart failure. The ER staff worked furiously to bring him back for a long time. At one point he did resuscitate, but before they could get him to the ICU, he crashed again. There was nothing they could do for this man. So tragic.\nThis all happened right next to my wife and I before we knew what was going on with my own heart. It scared the living shit out of both of us, and I\u0026rsquo;ll never, ever forget it.\nLife is really fucking short and can be taken from you in a heartbeat \u0026ndash; literally.\nI should not be living to work. I should be working to live a full life with \u0026ndash; and for \u0026ndash; those most important to me. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to get wrapped up in a career. To hell with that now! Family and friends are what matter. And so does living a life that makes a difference to them. It took nearly six decades to see it clearly. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful I was shown the lesson with enough time to do something about it.\nNo matter what, hold your loved ones close. Let them know you love them every day. Patch the broken relationships even though it\u0026rsquo;s hard. Live each day with gratitude and wonder, because you could be gone in a matter of moments.\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2024/on-the-fragility-of-life/","summary":"Events happen in our lives that make us do a full stop and give a long, hard look at how things are.","title":"On the Fragility of Life"},{"content":"I planned on publishing a post like this myself, but @canion beat me to the punch, getting his out first… I’m going to use the same criteria he uses for making the cut:\nFor my purposes, to be considered an App of the Year, the software needs to be something I used extensively, value and enjoy. I also must feel I would miss them if they suddenly went away. Of course, it also needs to be a Mac App.\nWithout further ado, my list of the top five…\nLaunchBar I’ve been using LaunchBar since 2005, probably longer than any other Mac app I currently use, save BBEdit. I set up my wife’s old 2012 27\u0026quot; iMac last week to install macOS Sonoma via OpenCore Legacy Patcher, and through each step, I found my muscle memory wanting to launch some app with LaunchBar. I easily use this app a hundred times a day, every day.\nFantastical I live and die by my calendar these days. For me, the only calendar application worthy of being used on a Mac is Fantastical, hands-down. The natural language input is super useful and slick. The premium feature I love the most is Openings. For my work, I’ve got too many people wanting to meet with me for this or that. All I have to do is give them a URL and tell them to find an opening. This has saved me hours. I hate subscriptions, but to me, this app is worth it.\nSafari I’ve been a Chrome user for many years now. But, two things made me change to Safari this year. First, Chrome has become a memory hog. As I write this, for the same five tabs open, Chrome is using 235MB of memory among 45 threads, whereas Safari is only using 151MB across 10 threads. Less memory and thread usage means better battery life. Second is the privacy philosophies between Apple and Google. Enough said on that one.\nIvory I’ve been on Mastodon since 2018, but as the platform becomes more popular and my use picks up, I find myself leaning more and more on Ivory. I started out with Mona as my Mastodon client – which is a great app too – but I just find myself gravitating more and more to Ivory. I can’t put my finger on why. It’s just the one I prefer between the two.\nBBEdit Parts of my job require me to transform and manipulate large amounts of data in all kinds of ways. When it comes to a text editor (for .csv files), BBEdit is the application of choice for me. I’ve been using BBEdit since version 1.0, even longer than I’ve been using LaunchBar. I’d die without this app. For me, it’s worth the $30 upgrade every few years. If you’re a long-time Mac user, you know what BBEdit is and what it’s capable of.\nApps That Fell Off the List Since this is the first year of my list, I can’t really say what fell off the prior, but these are the apps I’ve found myself using less and less over the last year or two.\nReeder - in favor of NetNewsWire. Both are really great apps, and I’m flopping back and forth between the two right now, but NetNewsWire is slightly edging out Reeder. Google Chrome - in favor of Safari, obviously. Agenda - I like the calendar integration of Agenda, but like @canion, I’m leaning more towards Obsidian for note taking as of late.

Maybe we want to be the hero, or we worry those who needed us in the past no longer will and that we won\u0026rsquo;t be their go-to person anymore.\nOur ego persuades us take on more and more, forcing us to say yes when our heart is telling us we should be saying no. Before we know it, the commitments have piled up on us again.\nWe wake up one day and realize we\u0026rsquo;ve allowed so many things back into our lives that we dread getting out of bed and facing them. We\u0026rsquo;re over-committed again and can no longer see the forest for the trees in our lives.\nWhen this happens to me, I make a day of solitude away from distractions and reflect on how I got to this point again. Then I figure out what I need to do to get life back on track.\nI accept I won\u0026rsquo;t always be able to say no when I should. The only thing I can do is learn from caving in to my ego and grow from it.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m stretched thin, these are some of the things I do to start cutting out the commitments that I should have said no to from the beginning.\nWho\u0026rsquo;s Affected? I ask myself who\u0026rsquo;s affected most?\nNaturally, the person I\u0026rsquo;ll be letting down will be disappointed, but I ask myself who else has been neglected because I have so much on my plate?\nUsually it\u0026rsquo;s my family that suffers most when I allow distractions. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget these are the important relationships to nurture. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones that are always the closest, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to put them on the back burner. I learn more and more when I overcommit that I should be guarding these relationships fiercely.\nNot only does my family suffer, but so does my health. I end up having so much going on that I don\u0026rsquo;t get proper sleep, exercise and I don\u0026rsquo;t eat well enough.\nIn the end, I wind up feeling burnt-out on life as a whole and get cranky with everyone around me. The most important relationships have wound up paying the price because I said yes when I should have said no.\nCan Someone Else Do It? I have to let go of my ego and turn the work over to someone else who can do the job just as well as I would have, if not better.\nI remind myself I\u0026rsquo;m not the only person in the world who has the talents to tackle a particular project. In fact, there may even be someone else who\u0026rsquo;s much more qualified than I ever was. This helps to remind me it\u0026rsquo;s okay to step aside.\nIt might even be good to let someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t as capable handle it. Allowing people to be challenged is usually when they grow the most.\nIs it Important? Sometimes the thing someone asked from me really isn\u0026rsquo;t as important to them as I think it is. I have to ask them how important it is that I be the one to do it for them.\nMaybe they don\u0026rsquo;t even care about it anymore, or know of someone else who can do it in my place. I\u0026rsquo;ll never know unless I ask.\nHold Your Ground Of course, backing out of a commitment is akin to lighting a match that\u0026rsquo;ll burn a bridge. I have to be open to being the target for disappointment and hurt feelings.\nBut I also have be ready to share how the commitment is affecting important areas of my life. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s even hurting the relationship between me and this person. I share this so the friendship doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a turn for the worst.\nMost people will understand and be sympathetic to a plight if you\u0026rsquo;re stretched too thin, though some may not.

At least it would seem traumatic to a three-and-a-half-year-old little boy. Though it didn’t turn out to be the end of the world, it seemed like hell when it happened. I still carry the memory with me more than a half-century later, so it damaged me on some level.\nMy family – mother, wicked step-father, newborn baby sister and me – were living in an old two-story house in Lancaster, California, which in the late 1960s was still mostly desert scrub and Joshua trees. We were located far enough away from everything else that it could be called the middle of nowhere. Today, a strip mall stands where the house once did.\nWe were so remote that my mother didn’t really pay attention to what I was getting into. She trusted I would not stray too far and everything would just work itself out. She had a newborn baby to worry about and didn’t give me the attention I probably should have gotten. With nothing to do and no watchful eye, I would wander the acre-sized property, trying to keep myself entertained. This ended up being a theme in my childhood.\nOne day, I thought I could make friends with the ants who had built a nest out in the open area far behind the house. I was fascinated by how they scurried back and forth, some appearing from the mound while others disappeared into it.\nTo make friends with them, it seemed I should get close and be down at their level. This meant I had to sit next to the mound. So I planted myself there on the ground, wearing my tan shorts, striped t-shirt and little red sneakers. When the first few ants crawled on me, I thought they were welcoming my invitation to be friends.\nThese were not your garden variety ants, mind you. They were those red and black kind that are nearly a quarter of an inch long with strong mandibles. These ants were big, fast, and as it turns out, very aggressive.\nBefore I knew it, I was covered with dozens of ants that saw me as a threat to their home. The hive sounded the alarm and went on the attack. First, I felt one bite, then a few more and several more soon after that. Before I knew it, my skin was on fire as the big red and black ants bit me over and over. They were all over me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get them all off my body. This was pain unlike any other in my short time on earth.\nI got up from the ground in a panic and began stripping off my clothes as I ran toward the house screaming like a banshee. By the time I got to the back door, I was down to my underwear and little red sneakers, covered with big red welts. I ran upstairs where I found my mother nursing my half-sister. I’m sure the sight of her little boy bursting into the room practically naked with tears streaming down his face alarmed her.\nShe was able to calm me enough to get the story from me. She squished the few remaining ants she found in my hair, then broke out ointment to soothe the swollen bites. Her motherly attention dissolved my anxiety and I calmed down.\nMy mother and I reminisced about this many times over the years. We even talked about it the last time I saw her before she passed away. She always thought it was hilarious. I, however, remember it differently.\nTo this day, ants give me the heebie-jeebies – even the tiny black ones you see after leaving greasy or sugary food out. If I find even one ant crawling on me after sitting in the grass, I’ll start doing a very unmanly arm-flailing dance to get the critter off me as fast as I can.\nI learned a big lesson that day… Don’t sit on an ant mound without knowing the consequences, because you might get eaten alive. It was the last and only time I did.\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2018/ants/","summary":"Though it didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out to be the end of the world, it sure seemed like a living hell when it happened.","title":"The Ant Mound"},{"content":"After nearly fifty years, I can still remember the first time I smoked a cigarette. It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.\nI lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it\u0026rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.\nI was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom\u0026rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that\u0026rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I\u0026rsquo;d seen the adults do.\nOddly enough, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.\nOf course, my little boy brain didn\u0026rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I\u0026rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?\nThere were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I\u0026rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.\nUntil the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren\u0026rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.\nI began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.\nMy mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she\u0026rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I\u0026rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn\u0026rsquo;t quite work out as planned.\nSo at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. All the other kids my age were doing it, so why not me too? The problem was, I really liked smoking. I knew I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to stop. Other kids did it to be cool. I did it to feed the nicotine addiction.\nTwelve years went by, and then I met Pam.\nI still see the moment from our very first date in my mind\u0026rsquo;s eye. We were running across a busy street in downtown Santa Monica to get to the club where we were headed to see a band. In the middle of the street, the hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell to the ground from my shirt pocket with a loud plop sound. I bent down and picked them up. When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t date people who smoke.\u0026rdquo;\nThat was a punch to the face, but one I\u0026rsquo;m glad I took. Naturally, I didn\u0026rsquo;t light up on that date, or any other we had after that. We\u0026rsquo;re still married 25 years later and she\u0026rsquo;s my best friend. I made the choice to quit because of her and I\u0026rsquo;m proud to say I haven\u0026rsquo;t smoked a cigarette since before we were engaged.\nI can remember a bunch of different cigarettes I smoked through my life, but thanks to someone who is very special to me, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the very last one. For that, I\u0026rsquo;m forever grateful.\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2018/cigarettes/","summary":"I used to smoke a long time ago.

You’ve procrastinated yourself into a corner and realize it’s either time to just do it, or finally forget about it and move on.\nThat’s me, sometimes…\nI’ve had this blog for nearly 14 years. In all that time, I only have 11 posts to show for it. That’s less than one post per year, with the newest one being more than a year old. At one point, I had written dozens of posts. But like any good artist is prone to doing, I trashed most of them because I felt like they were fodder. I regret making that choice.\nI’ve seriously slacked in my writing since, which is sad, because I’ve always enjoyed the process. To me, putting words down, then moving them around to communicate an idea is fun. When I get into a flow, the words come out and land on the page. I don’t have to struggle with what I’m trying to say. They’re just there all of a sudden. When I tell a story through my writing, I feel like I’ve created this thing that lives and breathes on its own.\nTo be truthful, I made a fatal mistake a few years back. Struggling to find my own voice, I began modeling my work after what other people were doing. However, since it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my voice, I began to believe what I had to say didn’t make a difference, so why should I even bother? This grew into the worst case of writer’s block there ever was in the history of man.\nWell, probably not. I’m sure there have been worse cases by far better writers, but I became so utterly uninspired to write during the last five years that it literally hurt to even think about putting words down. The three posts I made in 2018 were not easy.\nTo make up for my lack of creativity, I found a great way to procrastinate – tweaking my WordPress theme about a hundred-gazillion times. It became all-consuming to get things just pixel perfect and then start over from scratch again. I’ve written and tweaked more CSS code than I’m willing to admit, though I have gotten pretty good at it. My site theme is practically everything I’ve ever imagined in my head at this point. I can’t improve on it much more, if at all.\nSo what do I do now?\nJust write.\nNow is the time to stop procrastinating and make something. It doesn’t require perfection. My work will get better with practice. It doesn’t need to have meaning or impart some deep zen-like wisdom to the reader. I just need to start getting the stuff in my head out into written word.\nHere and now is the best place for it, so this is where I’ve decided to begin again.\nWhat have you been putting off? Is now the time for you to start again too?\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2018/start/","summary":"Eventually you use up every excuse in your book for not doing the thing you keep saying you’re going to do.","title":"Start Somewhere"},{"content":"Life is so full of distractions. It seems everything is vying for our attention in one way or another these days, with most of it coming from our electronic gadgets.\nIf you take time to look up from your phone for a few minutes, you’ll find a sea of humanity with faces buried in their own device. It’s painful to watch. Personally, I’ve come to a point where I’ve had it with the digital distractions in my life, so this is what I’ve done about it.\nI Removed the Useless Apps from My Phone There was a time I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone. I know many people who have far more than that. I don’t know how they manage all those screens since I could barely cope with the number I had. I’d regularly forget where an app was, which would usually be somewhere on the third screen, beyond two other screens of mostly unused apps. Though I wasn’t aware of it, I’d made a game out of shuffling apps around on my home screens, hoping to one day land on the perfect combination that made perfect sense and put the universe back in order. Honestly, I think most of the apps on my phone back then got moved around more often than they were ever used. Once this dawned on me, I decided it was time to purge. The first order of business was to get rid of the useless time-wasting “social” apps. I removed them from my phone without hesitation, deciding if I want to spend time on Facebook, I’ll make time specifically for it. Now, I’m lucky if I look at the site more than three or four times a month. I don’t miss Facebook and could probably go without it entirely if I decided to. I only keep it around to stay in touch with extended family and old friends. I intentionally pared my “friend” list down to less than 50 people that I actually know too. After nuking the useless apps, I started an experiment with the remaining by moving the ones I didn’t absolutely need to a “folder” on the second home screen. If I used an app more than a few times in a week, it got “unpacked” and promoted back to the first home screen. After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen – including the four I’d left in the dock as “must-have” when I started. For apps that I didn’t touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again — where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps. I evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they’re not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I’m using my phone.\nI Set All But the Most Important Apps to a Badge Notification For the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I’ll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I’ll check it on my schedule, thank you very much. This includes email — both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn’t want up to the moment email notifications, and I’ve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I’ll look at it, maybe I won’t. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications — otherwise, my phone isn’t a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled. The only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too. Finally, I turned on “Do Not Disturb” mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am — which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead. If you’re a notification junkie like I was, it’s hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you’ll find you’re picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day. Give it a try. You’ll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.\nI Set Limits on Use As a family, we’ve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal. If we’re in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It’s okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It’s worked pretty well so far. These are some of the ways I’ve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you’re looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there’s a lot more going on around you than you realized.\n","permalink":"http://jimmitchell.dev/posts/2017/digital/","summary":"Life is so full of distractions.
